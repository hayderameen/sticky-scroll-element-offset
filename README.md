# Sticky Scroll Element based on Offset
It creates any element inside the DOM sticky.

Keep it sticky until a certain offset (another element in flow of DOM) is reached.

The element will then stop being sticky and stay put in certain position.

On scroll up, it becomes sticky again as the limit threshold is crossed.
